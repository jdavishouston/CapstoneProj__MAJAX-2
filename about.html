                We are the home of grassroots activism for civil rights and social justice and equity.
            </p>
            <p>
                We advocate, agitate, and litigate for the civil rights due to Black America.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our cities, schools, companies, and courtrooms, we are the legacy of W.E.B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells,
                Thurgood Marshall, and many other giants.
